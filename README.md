# Project Name: Festive Wonderland!
Festive Wonderland is a bright, cheerful VR holiday world in Meta Horizon Worlds, full of lights and fun decor. Explore cozy paths, visit the sleigh area, and enjoy the magic of the season!

# Inspiration
Festive Wonderland was inspired by the joy and warmth of the holiday season. I wanted to create a place that captures the feeling of stepping into a magical winter village, filled with colorful decorations, cozy scenes, and playful elements that spark nostalgia and imagination. The goal was to make a world that feels welcoming to everyone, whether they want to explore, socialize, or simply enjoy a comforting atmosphere.

# What it does
The world features handcrafted pathways, animated decorations, themed props, and interactive holiday elements arranged to guide visitors through a cheerful holiday environment. I focused on building a balanced layout, using vibrant colors and clear visual landmarks to make exploration feel natural and fun. Characters, candy canes, gingerbread houses, and holiday ornaments help bring the world to life and add personality at every corner. Furthermore, I wanted the user to feel fully immersed in a winter wonderland, experiencing the magic of the holiday!

# How I built it
I built Festive Wonderland using Meta Horizon Worlds’ Desktop Editor. This involved designing the environment, placing and customizing objects from the asset library, adjusting lighting for a warm and festive tone, and ensuring the world performs smoothly. I experimented with composition, camera angles, and pathways to make sure the world feels immersive from every viewpoint.

# Challenges I ran into
One of the main challenges was optimizing visuals while keeping the world detailed and lively. I also spent time balancing decoration density so the scene feels rich but not overwhelming. Another challenging part of creating the world was designing its lighting because I wanted the user to feel immersed in a festive wonderland with bright lights while also having the beautiful night sky above. Lastly, I created this project while balancing school work, so I focused on building a simple but fun and festive experience. Even with limited time, I learned a lot about the Horizon tools and world-building, and I am proud of what I was able to create for my first project.

# What's next for Festive Wonderland!
I plan to add more interactive features, holiday-themed mini activities, and new areas to explore so the world can evolve with future events and seasons. For example, I am thinking of creating a connected series of worlds, where users can visit different holidays within the same world: the other worlds would be Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Valentine's Day.
